# recurbate-ce
Simple Chrome extension to show the direct URL to media on Recurbate.com. To install, enable loading of unpacked extensions and load the folder named "RecurbateCE". A textbox with the direct link to the media will now be shown above the preview image on each media page. Opening this link in a new window will load a browser video player, which you can right-click on and choose "Save As" to save the media.

Please note: You may still be restricted to one or two downloads per day using this direct link! If this occurs, consider using a VPN or another means of changing your IP. You only need a new IP *while the video player loads*, once it is loaded and the first frame is showing, you can disconnect and choose "Save As" in order to use your proper bandwidth.
